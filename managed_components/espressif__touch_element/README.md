# Touch Element Library

[![Component Registry](https://components.espressif.com/components/espressif/touch_element/badge.svg)](https://components.espressif.com/components/espressif/touch_element)

The Touch Element Library is moved from [esp-idf](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) to the component registry since v6.0. It can help you design touch applications fast with the common elements like `button`, `slider` and `matrix`. It supports the touch events like `Press`, `Release`, `Long Press` and so on. You can get notified by registering the event callback or subscribe the events in the task.

> **Note**: The touch element library only supports ESP32-S2 and ESP32-S3 with the legacy touch driver. For the new touch driver, please refer to the [Touch Sensor](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s3/api-reference/peripherals/cap_touch_sens.html) documentation.
